This is a README file about the image processing program main.py

There are comments in the program describing the function of each function

Things worth mentioning here is that I have left some retired functions in the
program which is originally designed to improve the image but due to the classifier
have a worse result, those are left in there to show some development effort.

Every image shown in the Report.pdf can be reproduced in this program, simply uncomment
the codeline that is in line 120, 157-188 to show the image at each stage and the color
channel histogram before processing and after processing. The block of code also have
comment to describe the functions.
